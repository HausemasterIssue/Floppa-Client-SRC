# Floppa very unhappy :(

What you see here is the SRC of the prebuilt Floppa client .jar file. It is not a skid, and it actually has a few decent modules. It is not buildable, so you can only jew code from it for now. I think the original author is BrownZombie, so credits to him for making this semi-decent client. It literally took me less than 5 minutes to go from a .jar to the full SRC. No hate to BrownZombie, but it was a very easy leak also TEAM WAO IS ASS!
